    "description": "Dr. Gunther Guiles was an accomplished and respected historian, known best for his research on the mysterious unknown. He decides to retreat to his cabin far away from civilization to record the extraordinary discovery from his latest research. Quite some time has passed since his retreat and no one has seen or heard from him in months. It's as if he vanished without a trace! Rumor has it that many of the doctor's discoveries revolved around ancient myths and folklore, with some believing his natural curiosity got the better of him. Could he have pressed too far in his quest to solve life's greatest mysteries? It's up to your group of reporters to uncover the truth and report it to the world!",

So, Lucky set off to California to claim his gold mine believing it was his Last Chance to strike it rich. Upon arrival in San Diego in 1882, Lucky sent away for a mail-order bride believing it was his Last Chance to marry. Upon arriving in Buckman Springs, they learned that the mine was located on the Lost Stickman Tribe burial grounds. According to the locals, the Lost Stickman Tribe cursed anyone who dared disturb the resting place of their ancestors. Evil spirits had guarded the mine for hundreds of years, and others who tried to extract gold from the mine either died or disappeared. Lucky was also warned that parts of the mine had caved-in and was just worthless Fool’s Gold. Being a gambler at heart, Lucky formulated a backup plan – if the mine turned out to be just Fools Gold as rumored, then he would set up a casino inside the mine and bilk the locals and travelers out of their money. Confident in his foolproof scheme, Lucky and his bride rode off into the sunset – but they were never seen again. Will you be able to solve the mysterious disappearance of Lucky and his mail-order bride? If you think you still want to enter the old mine and are lucky enough to escape the curse, we suggest you pause for a moment before you venture into the mine shaft, and say goodbye to your teammates – after all, it might be your Last Chance to see them alive!",

    "description": "Watch your head and your step as you navigate underground booby-trapped caves searching for the lost treasure of the infamous pirate, Captain William Leg. In 1855, Captain Leg (nicknamed One-Leg Willy after a losing battle with Piranhas) and his crew, MoonaLisa Mermaid and Cigar Sam, sailed a small ship loaded with treasure chests up the San Diego River and disappeared into a large cavern. A few hours later, an earthquake collapsed the entrance trapping the ship. The caverns and Willy’s treasure remained lost until 1953 when a group of SDSU geologists studying earthquake faults discovered a cave system stretching for miles deep underground and culminating in a subterranean lake. They dubbed the caves “Nightwalker Caverns” after learning the caves were used by bootleggers during Prohibition in the 1920s. Newspaper headlines chronicled cave explorers’ encounters with poisonous serpents, tunnel cave-ins, strange electro-magnetic phenomena, and hairy human-like cave dwellers--but no treasure. In fact, the treasure remained just another legend until March 21, 1955, when newspaper banners proclaimed that Chester Klinker, a local developer, had found One-Leg Willy’s treasure map while building an office building. The next day, another earthquake occurred, and Klinker was among several people reported missing. Locals claimed that Klinker built a secret entrance to the underground caverns in the office building basement so he could look for the treasure. Your group has made it as far as the basement door without getting caught by building security. You’ll have just 90 minutes to find One-Leg Willy’s map and search the basement for a hidden entrance to the caverns. Don’t lose yourself or your friends while immersed in this totally goony parody on pirate adventure movies. The treasure has already been lost, found, and lost again. Will you and your group find One-Leg Willy’s lost treasure?",

We’re hoping he’s just buried in a pile of his own conspiracy theories, but there’s always the chance he’s stumbled into something, or SOMEONE far weirder. Your Mission: Start at Agent Spooky's cabin, retrace his investigation, and figure out what’s really going on in Bellefleur. Keep an open mind, trust no one (especially the cows), and remember—the truth is out there... probably. Good luck, agents—you’re going to need it.",
